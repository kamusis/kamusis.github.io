      <span class="lx-post-detail"><i class="fa fa-calendar-o"></i> 2024-05-27</span>
      <p><h4 id="What-is-ASH"><a href="#What-is-ASH" class="headerlink" title="What is ASH?"></a>What is ASH?</h4><p>ASH, or Active Session History, is a feature in Oracle databases that records information about active sessions at regular intervals in both the database memory and persistent system tables. Data in memory is cleared after a database restart, but data in the persistent system tables is retained for a longer period. ASH is extremely useful for diagnosing issues when the database encounters problems or performance issues by allowing retrospective analysis to identify the root cause.</p>
<p>In MogDB, a similar ASH capability is implemented.</p>
<h4 id="ASH-Capability-in-MogDB"><a href="#ASH-Capability-in-MogDB" class="headerlink" title="ASH Capability in MogDB"></a>ASH Capability in MogDB</h4><p>The ASH capability in MogDB is divided into two parts: the open-source community version (openGauss) and the enhanced enterprise version.</p>
<p><strong>1. openGauss Community Version:</strong><br>MogDB inherits the ASH capability from openGauss. The database provides two main views: <code>dbe_perf.LOCAL_ACTIVE_SESSION</code> and <code>GS_ASP</code>. The <code>LOCAL_ACTIVE_SESSION</code> view is an in-memory table, while <code>GS_ASP</code> is a persistent table. These views contain sampling information about current active sessions.</p>
<p>Key parameters affecting ASH functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>enable_asp:</strong> Set to <code>on</code> or <code>off</code> to enable or disable ASH functionality. Default is <code>on</code>.</li>
<li><strong>asp_sample_interval:</strong> Specifies the interval between each sample. Default is 1 second. To reduce sampling pressure, this can be set to a longer interval, up to a maximum of 10 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>asp_sample_num:</strong> Specifies the total number of samples retained in the <code>LOCAL_ACTIVE_SESSION</code> in-memory table. Exceeding this number triggers a flush of in-memory samples to the <code>GS_ASP</code> system table and clears the in-memory table. Default is 100,000 samples.</li>
<li><strong>asp_flush_rate:</strong> Determines which in-memory samples are flushed to the <code>GS_ASP</code> table. Samples with <code>sampleid % asp_flush_rate == 0</code> are marked as <code>need_flush_sample=true</code> and are persisted. Default is 10, meaning 1&#x2F;10 of samples are persisted.</li>
<li><strong>asp_retention_days:</strong> Specifies the retention period for data in the <code>GS_ASP</code> table. Default is 2 days, with a maximum of 7 days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. MogDB Enterprise Version:</strong><br>The enterprise version enhances ASH capability, termed “SQL Execution State Observation,” by adding sampling of SQL execution operators. The <code>plan_node_id</code> field is added to views to record the execution operator during each sample, allowing identification of which step in the execution plan is causing performance issues.</p>
<p>Key parameters affecting enterprise ASH functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>resource_track_level:</strong> Set to <code>operator</code> to enable operator sampling capability. Default is <code>query</code>, which records only SQL-level sampling.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="LOCAL-ACTIVE-SESSION-View"><a href="#LOCAL-ACTIVE-SESSION-View" class="headerlink" title="LOCAL_ACTIVE_SESSION View"></a>LOCAL_ACTIVE_SESSION View</h4><p>This view records extensive information, including session ID, wait events, and SQL query ID (which can be linked to <code>dbe_perf.statement_history</code> or <code>dbe_perf.statement_complex_runtime</code> to retrieve SQL text and execution plans). </p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/10/24/UZR4wcX8lyeDHS7.png" alt="image-20221024155531233"></p>
<p>Note: The <code>plan_node_id</code> field exists only in the enterprise version.</p>
<h4 id="Recording-SQL-Execution-Plans"><a href="#Recording-SQL-Execution-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Recording SQL Execution Plans"></a>Recording SQL Execution Plans</h4><p>Querying the execution plans of past or currently executing SQL is a common requirement in database maintenance. In MogDB, the following views record SQL execution plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dbe_perf.STATEMENT_HISTORY:</strong> Records information about completed SQL, including execution plans (<code>query_plan</code> field).</li>
<li><strong>dbe_perf.STATEMENT_COMPLEX_RUNTIME:</strong> Records information about currently executing SQL, including execution plans (<code>query_plan</code> field).</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters affecting recording of SQL execution plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>enable_resource_track:</strong> Enables or disables resource tracking. Default is <code>on</code>. If set to <code>off</code>, no user SQL execution information, including execution plans, is tracked.</li>
<li><strong>resource_track_cost:</strong> Sets the minimum execution cost for SQL statements to be tracked. Only SQL with a cost above this value will have its execution plan recorded.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Comprehensive-Query-Example"><a href="#Comprehensive-Query-Example" class="headerlink" title="Comprehensive Query Example"></a>Comprehensive Query Example</h4><p>The following query retrieves all information about ongoing SQL executions, including historical samples:</p>
<figure class="highlight sql"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">SELECT</span> las.sample_time, las.application_name, las.unique_query_id, las.event, scr.query, scr.query_plan</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">FROM</span> dbe_perf.local_active_session las, dbe_perf.statement_complex_runtime scr</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">WHERE</span> las.thread_id <span class="operator">=</span> scr.pid <span class="keyword">AND</span> scr.pid <span class="operator">&lt;&gt;</span> pg_backend_pid();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Example output shows a frequently executed full table scan query, including SQL text, execution plan, and client information, providing valuable data for performance diagnosis.</p>

      <p><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction:"></a>Introduction:</h2><p>In the world of development and system administration, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has become a valuable tool. It allows users to run a Linux distribution alongside their Windows environment, opening up a world of possibilities for developers and administrators. In this article, we’ll guide you through the process of migrating a WSL instance, using a real-world example, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites:"></a>Prerequisites:</h2><p>Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or later with WSL installed.</li>
<li>An existing WSL instance (in our case, Ubuntu).</li>
<li>Sufficient storage space for the migration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-1-Create-a-Target-Directory"><a href="#Step-1-Create-a-Target-Directory" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Create a Target Directory"></a>Step 1: Create a Target Directory</h2><p>To start the migration process, we need a target directory to store the migrated WSL instance. In PowerShell, use the ‘mkdir’ command to create this directory. In our example, we create a directory named ‘D:\WSL\Ubuntu’:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mkdir <span class="literal">-p</span> D:\WSL\Ubuntu</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-2-List-All-Running-WSL-Instances"><a href="#Step-2-List-All-Running-WSL-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: List All Running WSL Instances"></a>Step 2: List All Running WSL Instances</h2><p>Before we proceed further, let’s list all the running WSL instances. The following command will display a list of all WSL instances, including their state and version:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">-l</span> <span class="literal">--all</span> <span class="literal">-v</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-3-Export-the-Source-WSL-Instance"><a href="#Step-3-Export-the-Source-WSL-Instance" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Export the Source WSL Instance"></a>Step 3: Export the Source WSL Instance</h2><p>Now, let’s export the source WSL instance (in our case, ‘Ubuntu’) into a tar file. This step automatically shuts down the WSL instance and restarts it after the export:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">--export</span> Ubuntu D:\WSL\Ubuntu.tar</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-4-Unregister-the-Source-WSL-Instance"><a href="#Step-4-Unregister-the-Source-WSL-Instance" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Unregister the Source WSL Instance"></a>Step 4: Unregister the Source WSL Instance</h2><p>Once the export is complete, we need to unregister the source WSL instance to avoid conflicts. Use the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">--unregister</span> Ubuntu</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-5-Confirm-Unregistration"><a href="#Step-5-Confirm-Unregistration" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Confirm Unregistration"></a>Step 5: Confirm Unregistration</h2><p>To confirm that the source WSL instance has been successfully unregistered, run the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">-l</span> <span class="literal">--all</span> <span class="literal">-v</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-6-Import-into-the-Target-Directory"><a href="#Step-6-Import-into-the-Target-Directory" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Import into the Target Directory"></a>Step 6: Import into the Target Directory</h2><p>Now it’s time to import the previously exported WSL instance into the target directory. In this step, we specify the target directory and version (in our case, version 2):</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">--import</span> Ubuntu D:\WSL\Ubuntu D:\WSL\Ubuntu.tar <span class="literal">--version</span> <span class="number">2</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-7-Verify-the-Migration"><a href="#Step-7-Verify-the-Migration" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Verify the Migration"></a>Step 7: Verify the Migration</h2><p>To ensure that the migration was successful, list all WSL instances once again:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">-l</span> <span class="literal">--all</span> <span class="literal">-v</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Step-8-Access-the-Migrated-WSL-Instance"><a href="#Step-8-Access-the-Migrated-WSL-Instance" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Access the Migrated WSL Instance"></a>Step 8: Access the Migrated WSL Instance</h2><p>Now, you can access the migrated WSL instance by using the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight powershell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">wsl <span class="literal">-d</span> Ubuntu</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a>Conclusion:</h2><p>Migrating WSL instances is a powerful way to manage and organize your development environments. By following these steps, you can seamlessly move your WSL instances to different directories or machines, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in your development workflow. Keep in mind that WSL provides a bridge between Windows and Linux, allowing you to enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
